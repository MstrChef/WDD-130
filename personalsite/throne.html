            The Shattered Throne dungeon starts off with a Puzzle that involves different symbols. You will need to search for the first symbol that shows up after deafting the outside of the main building. Once you find this symbol then you will kill the yellow bar enemy and get a new symbol to find and so on until you get a hawk flying down symbol which will take you back to the starting spot.

        VORGETH, THE BOUNDLESS HUNGER

            The first boss that you will face is Vorgeth. This fight is very straightforward. The boss will spawn in the middle of the room and you will see enemies spawning to on all sides of him. What you need to do is kill the 4 yellow health bar wizards around the room and pick up the orb that they drop. The wizards spawn where the stars are located in the picture. Once you have picked up all 4 orbs you will noticed a buff on the left side of the screen, this indicates that it is time for boss damage. Procede to one of the glowing circles, the green dots on the image, and interact with it. This will cause a short animation and you can now hit the boss for a period of time. If you are unable to kill the boss during this time you will just repeat the process until he is dead.

        DUL INCARU, THE ETERNAL RETURN

            The second boss that you will face is also the final boss of the dungeon. You will notice three knights standing in the center of the room when you approach it. Each of these knights will drop an orb when killed and you need to pick up all three of the orbs to damage the boss. The trick is to get each of the knights to low health and then kill them all around the same time because if you wait too long between kills, the remaining knights will be immune to damage and you will have to start over. Once you pick up the three orbs a timer will start on the left side of the screen and you can hit the boss during this time. If you are not going to kill the boss by the time the timer will end, you will need to jump on the glowing platform in the middle of the room to cancel the effect and keep you alive.
