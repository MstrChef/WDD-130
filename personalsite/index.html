    In the game Destiny 2 there are many different activites that involved multiple people working together. The two types of activites are Raids, which involve 6 people, and Dungeons which involve 3 people.

    I have been playing Destiny since 2015 and have had lots of experience playing the different raids and dungeons in the game. I have had some experiences playing with other players that have been good epxerience but I have also had my fair share of bad experiences too. I thought about creating this website to help others to not have to go through what I went through and actually have a step up in the game so that others will want to play with them.
