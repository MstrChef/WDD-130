        <p2 style="font-size: 25px">In the game Destiny 2 there are many different activites that involved multiple people working together. The two types of activites are Raids, which involve 6 people, and Dungeons which involve 3 people. As you first starting playing the game, you will not be a high enough level to attempt these multiple person activites. Once you get a higher level, the multiple person activites became the main focus of activities to do in the game.
        </p2>
    
        <p style="font-size: 25px">I have been playing Destiny since 2015 and have had lots of experience playing the different raids and dungeons in the game. I have had some experiences playing with other players that have been good experiences but I have also had my fair share of bad experiences too. I thought about creating this website to help others to not have to go through what I went through and actually have a step up in the game so that others will want to play with them.
