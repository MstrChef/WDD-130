        The main mechanic in Duality is the Bell. When you shoot the bell it will send you into the nightmare realm also called the red realm. When you shoot the bell from the red realm it will send you back into the normal world. In order to shoot a bell you will need to open it by killing the bell bearers that are near it. This will become important during the boss fights, but during the jumping sections this will not be a problem.

        NIGHTMARE OF GAHLRAN, SORROW BEARER
    </p>
    <section class="msg">
        <p2 style="font-size: 25px">
            Gahlran is the first boss you will face in the duality dungeon, and it has a simple method that you will repeat a few times to kill the boss. When you land in the room you will notice 2 doors to the left and right. When you shoot the bell you will see that the doors open. You want to look for 2 Psions that are called standard bearers. Killing them will drop a standard for you to pick up. Once you have grabbed both standards, you will want to leave the nightmare realm. The next step requries that you place the standard at the location with the same symbol that is on the left side of your screen. Enter the door when it opens and then hit the bell. You will see lots of enemies in the room and you need to kill them to start the damage phase. Deal damage to the boss and then leave the nightmare realm before time expires and repeat until the boss is dead.

        THE VAULT
    </p>
    <section class="msg">
        <p2 style="font-size: 25px">
            The second boss fight that you will have is the vault. This fight is very similar to the first with the standards that you will need to grab. Start by looking at the four mini walls to the sides and find the matching symbols in the middle. Shoot the bell to enter the nightmare realm and then proceed up the stairs of the matching symbols and kill all the enemies. Standards will drop and you will then proceed back to the middle and go back to the normal world. When you return, you will need to place the standards at their related spots and then kill the boss. There are three bosses at this section so you will need to repeat this twice.

            NIGHTMARE OF CAIATL, PRINCESS IMPERIAL
    </p>
    <section class="msg">
        <p2 style="font-size: 25px">
            Caiatl is the final boss in the duality dungeon. This fight is very similar to the vault. You will locate the standard icons you need in the middle of the room and then proceed to the ledge that has the corresponding picture. Shoot the bell and then kill the standard bearer that will be right next to you. Once you grab the standard, proceed back into the normal realm and plant it. You will repeat this step to get the final two needed. Once you have placed all four standards you will need to shoot the red jewels on the chains to send caiatl into the nightmare realm for boss damage time. When you ring the giamt bell, wait until it sends you into the realm instead of shooting a bell. This will prevent enemies from spawning for a period of time, allowing you to focus on killing the boss instead. Caiatl will start at the back of the room and then proceed to either the left, right or middle bell. Kill the bell bearers near you bell and then run to whichever way she is running. You will need to shoot the bell she is going to when she is close to it to stun her and give you a damage buff so that you can kill her. After the first bell expires she will move to one of the remaining bells. She will go to all three bells and then return to the normal world, and you will need to repeat this proces until she dies.
